# Intro
Hi my name is Ross, and I'm learning to code using Python. 

## Background 
I have a Ph.D in Molecular Biology. My Ph.d focus was miRNA biogenesis and RNA decay. I studies at the University of Edinburgh, before moving to Aarhus University to take on my postdoc project of characterising the temporal RNA binding landscape of RBP that influence RNA fate. Next, I moved on to Roche Innovation Centre Copenhagen to take up a Senior Scientist position in drug discovery.
