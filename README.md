# Intro
Hi, my name is Ross, and I'm learning to code using Python. 

## Background 
I have a Ph.D in Molecular Biology. My Ph.D focus was miRNA biogenesis and RNA decay. I studied at the University of Edinburgh, before moving to Aarhus University to take on my postdoc project of characterising the temporal RNA binding landscape of RBP that influences RNA fate. Next, I moved on to Roche Innovation Centre Copenhagen to take up a Senior Scientist position in drug discovery.
